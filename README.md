# Web-Design-Challenge

In this project a Python script were made to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

For these exercies need a Weather API key for [Open Weather.com](https://openweathermap.org/) and API key for Google Map

This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed. The scripts are in the [API-Challenge](https://github.com/raciv65/API-Challenge.git) repository.
